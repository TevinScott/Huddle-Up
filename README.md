# project description
HuddleUp is an event planning and scheduling application. Users can create
an event, invite users, and post updates to the event. Users invited to the
event can ask questions about the event.

# version
1.0

# getting started
To make a copy of the project on your local machine, simply clone the repository.
Navigate to your development directory and use the command 
'git clone https://<yourusername>@bitbucket.org/hagessner/huddleup.git'.
Follow your clone up with a 'git pull' to ensure your files are up to date.


# making changes
To commit your changes to the code bank, simply navigate to the 'huddleup' folder
in your development directory. Use the command 'git add .' to add all changes to 
your commit. Then do 'git commit -m "your commit message.";' to commit your changes
and add a comment. Then do 'git pull' to make sure that you are up to date before 
pushing your changes out. You can then do 'git push' to push your changes to 
your working branch.


# development workflow
Naturally it is a good idea to create a new branch off of your working stable branch
(usually master) for every new task. A task is basically one new feature that you are
adding to the project. More workflow description to come.
